# ANN-CNN-assignment
First Part of the project for Computational Intelligence elective course 2020-2021 for CEID.
We create and train an Artificial Neural Network with the MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Dataset for A1 to A4 questions, trying to optimize different parameters/hyperparameters of the model.
Then we create, train and compare 3 different CNN models with the same dataset.
